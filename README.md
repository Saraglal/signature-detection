# signature-detection
This project utilizes YOLOv8, an advanced object detection algorithm, to detect signatures in images. By drawing bounding boxes around the detected signatures, it provides a visual indication of their location within the image. This capability is useful for automating document processing, fraud detection, and identity verification tasks.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Saraglal/signature-detection.git
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    - Python 3.11
    - OpenCV
    - PIL (Python Imaging Library)
    - Ultralytics library

3. Download the YOLOv8 weights from [ultralytics GitHub](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics).
